# Types of Network Scans

* Uncredential: Does not utilize privleged credentials. Limited in scope but can still identify basic vulerabilities.
* Credential: Utilizes privleged credentials to provide a more in-depth anlysis with accurate resilts.

  #### I have attached examples of conducted scans from my MacOS device. It showcases how much more information can be acquired from a credentialed scan compared to a uncredentialed scan.

        Note: Scans took place a month apart from each other to show how quickly vulnerabilities can manifest.

### Vulnerabilities

* Found vulnerabilities: 49
    * 2 CVSS
    * 47 of the vulnerabilities are infomational, which are actually facts rather than vulnerabilities.

### Remediations

Credential scans have a leg up on uncredential scans due to the privleged access it has to machines. Nessus provides remediations for 
]known CVEs when credentialed scans are conducted.

    Note: I have applied remediations to my device to make it vulnerability free.
